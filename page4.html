    <h4>Chicken Lolopop</h4>
    <p>
        Chicken lollipop is a popular Indo-Chinese fried chicken appetiser. Chicken lollipop is essentially a frenched chicken winglet, wherein the meat is cut loose from the bone end and pushed down, creating a lollipop appearance.[1]

Recipe
Recipes vary from individuals.[2] However, many start by using the middle segment of the chicken wing or thigh. The middle segment has one of the two bones removed, and the flesh on the segments is pushed to one end of the bone. These are then coated in a spicy red batter whose main ingredients include red chili powder, and turmeric.[3] The coated chicken is then marinated for a couple of hours. The marinated chicken is usually deep fried in oil, but another well-known choice includes baking. The exposed bone is sometimes wrapped in aluminum foil.
